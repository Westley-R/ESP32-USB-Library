# USB Library

This is a project aimed at connecting a USB device, such as a keyboard (my main focus), to the ESP32-C6. Though it was desgined and tested on a C6, it should work with most other ESP32 models.

## How to Use

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target <chip_name>`.

### Hardware Required

* A development board
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming
* Some kind of USB breakout board
* A USB device to connect to

See [Development Boards](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits) for more information about it.

### Configure the Project

Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`). (Not yet implimented!!!)

In the `USB Configuration` menu:

* Select the USB pins in the `USB GPIO Pins` option.
  * Use any pair of GPIO pins
  * Default is `D- = 0` & `D+ = 1`

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

Ignore this section, I'm leaving it in as a refference for when I create an example output. 

As you run the example, you will see the LED blinking, according to the previously defined period. For the addressable LED, you can also change the LED color by setting the `led_strip_set_pixel(led_strip, 0, 16, 16, 16);` (LED Strip, Pixel Number, Red, Green, Blue) with values from 0 to 255 in the [source file](main/blink_example_main.c).

```text
I (315) example: Example configured to blink addressable LED!
I (325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (1325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (2325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (3325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (4325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (5325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (6325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
I (7325) example: Turning the LED ON!
I (8325) example: Turning the LED OFF!
```

Note: The color order could be different according to the LED model.

The pixel number indicates the pixel position in the LED strip. For a single LED, use 0.

## Troubleshooting

* If the LED isn't blinking, check the GPIO or the LED type selection in the `Example Configuration` menu.

For any technical queries, please open an [issue](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues) on GitHub. We will get back to you soon.
